## üé¨ Project Overview

Grease Pencil bridges the gap between idea and execution in screenplay writing. With just a title, genre, and one-line plot summary, the application leverages advanced AI to generate a structured screenplay following the industry-standard "Save the Cat" beat sheet methodology. 

What would normally take weeks or months of outlining, structuring, and drafting can now be accomplished in a fraction of the time, allowing writers to focus on creative refinement rather than starting from scratch.

### Key Value Proposition

**Expand Any Idea into a Complete Screenplay**: Transform a simple concept into a fully-structured, production-ready screenplay of 80-120 pages (approximately 200,000 words) spanning around 60 scenes. Grease Pencil handles the structural heavy lifting, allowing you to focus on creative refinement.

**Overcome Writer's Block**: Whenever you get stuck, Grease Pencil's AI tools can help you continue a scene, rewrite dialogue, expand descriptions, or restructure content while maintaining the context of your entire script.
